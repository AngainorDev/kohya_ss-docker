## What's this?

You should compile yourself xformer, torchvision, torch and tensorflow for your architecture and GPU capabilities and put the wheels here.  
You can also simply download them from the pip repository and use the default one (too bad...you are leaving performance behind...).  

Open the [.tensorflow](.tensorflow), [.torch](.torch), [.torchvision](.torchvision), [.xformers](.xformers) to find the tested and approved for stability versions.
Use [the PyPi website](https://pypi.org/) to search and download the library is you're not willing to compile them by yourself, then put the *.whl here and compile the docker image.
