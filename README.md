# kohya_ss-docker
This is the tandem repository to exploit on linux the kohya_ss training webui converted to Linux.  

Read the data sections for [wheels](kohya_ss/data) and [packeages](kohya_ss/data/libs) prior to compiling the image or IT WILL FAIL.  

## TK and Xorgs

Remember to allow docker hosts to clients to your X server.

```bash
# Unsecure way to do (I take no responsability if you do this way) !! 
# You should add the exact host but I leave that to you.
xhost +
```

Happy training on Linux!!!
